# Background
The [offcial McGill LRS catalog](https://lrs.mcgill.ca/) only allows selection by semesters. But, users usually want to watch the recording of a specific course, without knowing which semester was it recorded (or whether it was ever recorded). In the offcial catalog, users have to go through all the semesters hoping to find the course they were looking for. Bad user experience.
